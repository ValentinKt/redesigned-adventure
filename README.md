**Redesigned Adventure** is a unique project respectfully dedicated to promoting environmental awareness and ethical responsibility.

- Offering a range of functionalities that enable users to create and take part in events related to environmental cleaning activities.

- We can create _events_ and invite others to join us, in making a positive impact on the environment. 
So that attendees can come prepared with the tools and equipment, and you can specify the type of waste that will be collected. ;-)

- You can browse through upcoming events near your location and add yourself as an attendee. 
	Our goal is to make it easy for individuals and groups to get involved in environmental cleanup activities and make a positive impact on their local community.

- **Together**, working for a collective and universal goal: Make our planet cleaner and healthier.

- Taking part in this humanitarian project to promote environmental awareness and moral responsibility for each.

- This project is yours too! Use it to a good use!
_So, Donâ€™t hesitate to propose new features and improvement_ ;-)
