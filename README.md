### **REDESIGN ADVENTURE** :earth_africa: 

  ```As one, we can make a cleaner and healthier planet for ourselves and future generations.```

##

**REDESIGN ADVENTURE** is a unique project respectfully dedicated to promoting environmental awareness and ethical responsibility.

- Offering a range of functionalities that enable users to create and **`take part in events related to environmental cleaning activities.`** 

- We can create `events` and invite others to join us, in making a `positive impact on the environment`. 
So that attendees can come prepared with the tools and equipment, and you can specify the type of waste that will be collected. ;-)

- You can browse through upcoming events near your location and add yourself as an attendee. 
- Our goal is to make it easy for individuals and groups to get involved in environmental cleanup activities and make a positive impact on their local community.

- `Together`, working for a collective and universal goal: **`Make our planet cleaner and healthier.`** :earth_africa:	

- Taking part in this humanitarian project to promote  `environmental awareness` and moral responsibility for each.
